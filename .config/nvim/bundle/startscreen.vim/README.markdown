Customize Vim's start screen.

This is a much simpler version of [vim-startify](https://github.com/mhinz/vim-startify).

By default it displays a random `fortune(6)`, but this can be configured. Many
Linux systems don't ship with `fortune(6)` by default any more (shame on them!)
so you may get errors if you don't have it installed.

Set `g:Startscreen_function` to your prefered function to run on startup.

See `:help startscreen` for the full documentation.
